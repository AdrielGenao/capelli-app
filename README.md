# capelli-app
This project is my development of a mobile app for my family's business of selling beauty/barber supplies. It will utilize a system of viewing featured and on-sale products, a payment system, and other features of a typical online-selling mobile app. This expo link can be used to see my current progress and to see the app in action as I continually work on it, however the GitHub code will be continually updated as well: https://snack.expo.dev/@adrielgenao/capelliapp. The backend/python file that contains the code for database management is not here, as it saves me time to not have to upload two separate files, and minimizes the risk of showing/revealing security information of the database (and saves me time from having to change that sensitive information when uploading to GitHub). Either way, the Python file uses nothing new / does not use concepts that I have not used/learned before; the code of the backend for the app uses libraries/packages that I already have experience with (and is shown in the Python_Projects repository): Pandas, MySQL connector, and Flask.

NOTE -- The Android OS moves components upward when the keyboard is opened, and this setting cannot be changed within an Expo Snack, only in a project. Although still functional, it looks glitchy/wrong, and it can only be ignored for now.
